A small sublime text plugin that autocorrects when you press space.

Copy these files to .config/sublime-text-2/Packages/AutoCorrect/

To build from source run make in the src directory (if Sublime Text 2
is running it will segfault as the library is changed beneath it...)

Tested on Ubuntu Precise 12.04 x64.

The (modified) autocorrect list is taken from wikipedia:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines

Dependencies:
    Boost python
    Python 2.6 dev

Todo list
  - Other keys to trigger autocorrect
  - Use defined corrections

Bugs
  - The selection doesn't appear correctly if the correction contains punctuation or spaces
  - Some corrections in the list have multiple entries
